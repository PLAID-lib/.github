# Physics-Learning AI Datamodel

## Introduction

PLAID (Physics-Learning AI Datamodel) is a flexible and extensible framework for representing and sharing datasets of physics simulations. PLAID defines a unified standard for describing simulation data and is accompanied by a library for creating, reading, and manipulating complex datasets across a wide range of physical use cases.
The data model and library have initially been developped at SafranTech, the research center of [Safran group](https://www.safran-group.com/).

## Open source

The open source project is hosted on GitHub under the [PLAID-lib](https://github.com/PLAID-lib) organization. The project currently contains three librairies:

- [plaid](https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid) is the core library of the PLAID project.
- [plaid-bridges](https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid-bridges): provides integrations into machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric.
- [plaid-ops](https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid-bridges): a collection of standardized operations on PLAID samples and datasets.
